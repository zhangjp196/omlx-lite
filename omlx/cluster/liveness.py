"""Notice when a peer Mac goes away, instead of waiting forever.

A collective has no timeout. If a peer sleeps, loses its cable, or its rank
dies, every surviving rank blocks inside the all-reduce and the deployment
hangs until someone kills it by hand — which is exactly what happened when a
Thunderbolt cable was unplugged mid-session.

Ranks already publish a runtime marker with a heartbeat timestamp on each
update. This watches those markers plus the peers themselves, so a vanished
Mac becomes a stated failure with a reason rather than a stall.

Two limits are structural and worth stating rather than papering over.

**A marker is a rank-local file.** The coordinator reads remote markers through
a fixed SSH command, so runtime health means both the Mac and the exact worker
process are alive. Before launch there is no marker yet and reachability alone
is reported as ``status == "unknown"``.

**A marker outlives the rank that wrote it.** Only a clean exit removes one, so
a crash leaves debris that the next activation of the same deployment id reads
as a live-but-silent rank. A marker whose writing process is gone is treated as
absent.
