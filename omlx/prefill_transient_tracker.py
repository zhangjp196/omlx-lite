Per-scheduler prefill memory observations.

Used by the adaptive prefill throttle in Scheduler: when current memory
enters the caution zone (>= hard_cap * safe_zone_ratio), the next chunk
is sized so its predicted transient stays under the remaining headroom.

Owned by each Scheduler instance (one EWMA per loaded model), distinct
from the global PrefillProgressTracker which feeds the admin dashboard.
