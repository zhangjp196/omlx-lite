"""Per-cluster collective backend selection: JACCL everywhere, or TCP ring.

The rule is deliberately binary and fail-safe: ``jaccl`` is selected only when
**every** cluster member reports ``rdma_ctl`` enabled *and* at least one RDMA
device; anything else selects the TCP ``ring``. A single member without RDMA
silently downgrading only its own stage is exactly how half-configured JACCL
clusters hang at ``mx.distributed.init`` — the whole cluster shares one
backend, so the weakest member decides, out loud.

This module is pure: members arrive as data (from ``collect_cluster_status``
locally, from peer probes remotely, or from posted host records), which keeps
selection offline-testable. Live ``rdma_ctl`` state is re-verified at launch
preflight; a selection made from stale evidence can only fail closed there.

Ring is a first-class runtime path, not a degraded one: ring deployments run
through the same ``DistributedJobSupervisor`` verified teardown (process-group
SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation with proof, plus the marker-pid rank sweep —
including remote ranks over SSH) as JACCL deployments. Nothing in the teardown
machinery is backend-conditional.
