"""Cluster v2 discovery/identity HTTP endpoints.

``discovery_router`` is mounted WITHOUT ``require_admin`` in
``omlx/server.py`` so peers can probe ``/api/cluster/node_id`` before any
trust exists; it is still gated by the distributed-inference exposure flag
(``require_distributed_inference_enabled``) like the enrollment router. The
probe endpoint is rate-limited per source IP. ``/api/cluster/devices``
carries the trusted inventory and requires admin like the rest of the
cluster surface.
