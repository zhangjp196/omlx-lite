"""Put the right weight files on the right Mac, and nothing else.

A pipeline rank loads only its own layers, but the safetensors files holding
those layers still have to exist on that machine's disk. Copying the whole model
to every node wastes most of the transfer: for a 78-layer model split 56/22, the
node holding the tail needs 24 of 76 shards — 96 GiB instead of 309.

This module works out that mapping from the model itself and stages only what
each node is missing. It is the difference between "clustering needs a 300 GiB
copy to each Mac" and "clustering needs the shards you don't already have".
