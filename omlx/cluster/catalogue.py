"""Which of these models will actually run on this cluster, and how far.

The question anyone asks first — "can my two Macs run this?" — had no answer
short of trying it and watching a rank die. This answers it before anything is
staged or launched.

Every verdict comes from ``plan_hybrid``, the same planner activation uses. That
is the whole point: a second, simpler estimate would be a promise the cluster
does not keep. If planning raises, the model does not fit, and the planner's own
message says which node ran out and by how much.

Two things are worth more than a yes/no:

**How the model fits.** A model that needs both Macs pipelined is a different
proposition from one that fits on either alone — the first cannot survive a
peer going to sleep.

**How much context it fits.** Weights are the floor, not the cost. KV cache
grows with the prompt, so "fits" without a context length is close to
meaningless: a model can load happily and then fail on the first long request.
The largest context that still plans is found by bisection over the planner, so
the number is one the cluster can honour rather than an estimate of one.
