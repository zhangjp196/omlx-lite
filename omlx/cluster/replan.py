"""One-action cluster re-plan: deactivate → re-plan → reload.

Today a membership or budget change is a manual four-step dance: deactivate
the deployment, rebuild a plan, approve it, then reload the model. This module
is the pure/data half of collapsing that into a single ``POST
/admin/api/cluster/replan`` call (the route handler in
``omlx/cluster/routes.py`` owns the async orchestration):

- :func:`nodes_from_deployment` / :func:`hosts_from_deployment` derive the
  plan inputs for the *next* plan from the *current* approved deployment, so
  a replan with no explicit overrides re-plans the same cluster the operator
  already trusts. A pairing/membership inventory (the v2 discovery/pairing
  modules) can later supply overrides for added or removed nodes; until then
  the explicit ``nodes``/``hosts`` request fields are how membership changes
  are expressed.
- :func:`summarize_deployment` produces the compact, secret-free description
  of what a replan replaced.

Derivation caveats (documented contract, not bugs):

- ``max_weight_bytes`` / ``target_weight_bytes`` are operator preferences that
  live on the plan *request*, not on the signed assignment, so a derived
  replan cannot recover them and resets both to "automatic". Operators moving
  the split control must pass explicit ``nodes``.
- KV reservations and per-rank context limits are recomputed by the planner
  from ``target_context_tokens``, never copied forward.
- Signed performance profiles *are* copied forward.  Dropping them silently
  turns a heterogeneous tensor deployment back into an equal split on every
  replan, even when the previous activation already measured both ranks.
