"""Minimal ``torch`` stub for the DMG bundle.

xgrammar 0.2.3 declares ``torch>=1.10.0`` as a runtime dep, but oMLX never
exercises its torch-backed code paths: bitmasks are allocated as numpy
``int32`` buffers, the C++ binding fills them, and the MLX kernel applies the
mask. The torch dep is load-bearing only at *import time* — module-level code
in ``xgrammar.matcher``, ``xgrammar.testing``, ``xgrammar.contrib.hf`` and
``tvm_ffi.core`` does ``import torch`` plus a handful of attribute lookups.

Real torch is ~500 MB unpacked on macOS arm64 — too heavy to ship in the DMG.
This stub provides just enough of the torch surface for those modules to
finish loading. Code paths that would actually call into torch raise
``RuntimeError`` from the helpers below; oMLX never reaches them.

When a real torch is installed (pip / Homebrew flow) the stub is a no-op:
``install()`` checks ``importlib.util.find_spec('torch')`` first.
